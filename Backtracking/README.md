# Backtracking

## What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a problem solving technique which uses **Brute-Force Approach** strategy. In other words, it will try out all possible solutions and pick up the desired one.

This topic is suggested to be followed by [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/yenloned/Data-Structure-Algorithm-Study/tree/main/Dynamic%20Programming).

## Difference between Backtracking and Dynamic Programming
* Dynamic Programming is for **optimization**. There will be only **the best** solution.
* Backtracking is for **desired solution**. There will be **multiple solutions**.

## When will we use Backtracking?
For Backtracking, usually there will be some **constraints** in the problem. There will be two types of constraints.

### Implicit constraint
It is a rule in which how each element in a tuple is related.
### Explicit constraint
The rules that restrict each element to be chosen from the given set.
## Famous Backtracking Problems with constraints
* N-Queen
* Sum of Subset
* Graph Coloring
* Hamilton Cycle
